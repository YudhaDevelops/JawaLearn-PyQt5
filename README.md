# APPLICATION OF AUGMENTED REALITY TECHNOLOGY USING CNN (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK) IN LEARNING JAVANESE CHARACTERS

The JawaLearn application is an application built using machine learning, namely CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and using image data as a learning tool for the machine. By training different machines it is hoped that it will help you understand the form of Javanese script.

# Purpose of Building the Application
1. Makes it easy for you to learn Javanese script
2. Creating an Augmented Reality application by combining AI technology which can make teaching and learning Javanese script easier.
3. Proving that Augmented Reality technology can be combined together using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.
4. Contribute to overcoming students' difficulties in learning Javanese script using Augmented Reality technology

# JawaLearn Application Features
1. Classification of Javanese Script
   > This feature can be used to transliterate Javanese LEGENA characters with detection based on images of written characters entered either on the camera daci or the storage on your device.
   
3. AR Detection of Javanese Script
   > This feature can be used to transliterate Javanese LEGENA characters with real-time detection using the available camera. This feature gives meaning to the characters placed in front of the camera.
